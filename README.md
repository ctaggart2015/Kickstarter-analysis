# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
# Module 1: Kickstarting witch Excel Challenge
## Overview of Project/ Purpose of project
 For this project we are asked to compare the results of Louise’s play “Fever” to the results of different campaigns. With the use of the Kickstarter we can visualize the end result and the overall outcome. We are using visuals such as charts and graphs to display the outcome. The purpose of this project is to help understand Excel. We are to continue to use the workbook that we used while reading module one to figure what the outcomes are based on launch date along with goals.

## Challenges:
 For me I did have a couple of challenges mainly when writing the code. I was not entirely sure how to add the plays, so I changed the plays on the original Kickstarter by filtering out the category to plays instead of writing it into the code which resulted in the values for outcome of the goals to be wrong. I also messed up because I did not read carefully and instead of placing the launch date info the correct category, I put the end date which made all of the points for each month wrong. I need to more observant when reading to not make such simple mistakes.
 ## Results:
 ###  What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
 Based of the results shown in the graph we can see that the best months for the launch dates are summertime May, June, and July. It can be because of the number of plays that they had that launched during these months because they seem to have a great amount with May having a grand total of 166 of those 111 are successful, June having 153 with 100 successful, and July having 138 and 89 successful plays.
The worst month for the launch date seems to be December with January, March and November following suit. Even though January, March, and November are ranked more towards the bottom they still did a decent number of successful plays. For December what can be observed is the amount of is the lowest out of all of the months. The plays in December was pretty much neck and neck for successful and failed.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 Based on the graph we can observe that the most successful goal was less than 1000 with a 76% rate of success. The amount for least being 45000 to 49999 with the failed percentage being 100%.That there is a 0% for each of the canceled play goals.
 ###  What are some limitations of this dataset?
 It is not recent data. Sadly because of covid if it was more up to date I feel like the numbers would be more failure over successful for plays.
 ###  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 	Another graph I would use to display it is a bar graph. Possible showing amount pledged. Possible a graph to display future plays may look  like.
